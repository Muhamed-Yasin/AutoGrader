# AutoGrader
An automatic answer-sheet correction system that utilizes the power of NLP and ML. It utilizes word encoding and mathematical functions like cosine similarity to score answers and also takes into account how well written the answers are.
It also provides the functionality for checking the average response for a single question in the class as well as correcting a single answer sheet.
It takes advantages of word and sentence embedding techniques ranging from TFIDF, Word2Vec to transformers and Bert.
